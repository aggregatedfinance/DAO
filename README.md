# Aggregated Finance DAO

Welcome to the DAO proposal management tool for the AGFI Project.

Each proposal must be created as an `issue` in this project. Each proposal type will need to adhere to the guidance specified in the white paper, as well as templates defined within this document. Any proposals that do not follow these rules may be deleted at the discretion of the DAO Proposer team.

## Treasury Allocation Proposals

Each treasury allocation proposal requires the following information to be provided:

* The amount requested to transfer.
* The recipient of the amount. Each additional recipient will receive the specified amount in the proposal.
* The purpose of the transfer. This can include the allocation of the funds to delegated traders/farmers, to conduct purchases of specific assets, to perform token buybacks, or to pay external parties for services.
* Justification for the transfer, if one or any of the recipient addresses are not known to the team.

Each treasury allocation will undergo detailed scrutiny by the DAO proposal team, ensuring that all information provided meets sufficient standards to justify moving the proposal to the smart contract itself. Whilst any proposal can be opened on chain, it will not be queued for release by the timelock unless it has undergone the correct proposal processes.

## Contract Modification Proposals

Each contract modification proposal requires the following information to be provided:

* The specific contract parameter (e.g. Modify AGFI Channel 3 Buy Fee Rate)
* The purpose of the modification, and a justification as to requiring the modification to be made.

As modifications to the AGFI contract will not actually be performed by the DAO contract, the DAO custodian will be entrusted to execute the modification if the proposal passes the vote.

## Management Proposals

Each management proposal requires the following information to be provided:

* The modification to be made (e.g. add new DAO proposer)
* The purpose of the modification, and a justification as to requiring the modification to be made.

As modifications to the management aspects will not actually be performed by the DAO contract, the DAO custodian will be entrusted to execute the modification if the proposal passes the vote.
